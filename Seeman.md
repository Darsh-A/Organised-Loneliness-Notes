# Core Argument: Loneliness vs Isolation

> "Loneliness is **not simply being alone** or lacking social contact. It is a **subjective psychological state** rooted in how a person experiences their relationships."  
> (Seeman, Slide 2)
> 
> "Loneliness arises from a **perceived mismatch** between desired and actual social connection."  
> "Someone can feel lonely **even when surrounded by others**, and not lonely while alone. Therefore, loneliness cannot be reduced to: Social isolation, Lack of friends, [or] Objective social circumstances."  
> (Seeman, Slide 3)

Seeman begins by establishing that loneliness is fundamentally a **relational** and **subjective** phenomenon, not an arithmetic one.

- **Non-Reducibility:** Loneliness cannot be reduced to "objective social isolation" (simply having few people around). One can be solitary without being lonely, and one can be lonely in a crowd.
    
- **Perceived Mismatch:** The core mechanism of loneliness is a **discrepancy**. It is the gap between the desired level/quality of connection and the actual level/quality perceived by the subject. Because it relies on "desire" and "perception," it is a psychological state, not just an environmental fact.

# Standard View

> The standard view shares three core features:  
> • Loneliness is an **experience** (a subjective mental state or event).
> • It has a **negative valence**, being unpleasant or distressing.
> • It is **intentional or representational**, involving awareness of a discrepancy between desired and actual social relationships.
> (Seeman, Slide 5)

Seeman synthesizes various psychological and philosophical definitions into what he calls the **"Standard View."** This view has three necessary conditions:

1. **Experiential:** Loneliness is not a silent physiological condition; it must be felt. It is a **subjective mental state**.

2. **Negative Valence:** It is intrinsically painful. The experience is marked by distress or suffering. If one enjoys the lack of contact, it is Solitude, not Loneliness.

3. **Intentional/Representational:** This uses the philosophical concept of **intentionality** (the "aboutness" of a mental state). Loneliness is not just a vague mood; it is about a specific lack. It **represents** the gap between what the person needs socially and what they currently have.

# Three Philosophical Approaches to Loneliness

> One can take it that loneliness is directed at or about something. I call such views 'objectivist' or 'intentionalist'. Secondly, one could seek to understand the experience of loneliness as what you might call a 'mood'. I call such views 'subjectivist'. A third way is in terms of an embodied and enacted relation. I call such views, 'relationist' or 'embodied'.  
 (Seeman Reading, Page 5)

Seeman tries to explain the **experience** of loneliness in three frameworks:

#### 1. Objectivist (Intentionalist)
This view treats loneliness like **perception**. Just as visual experience is directed at an apple, loneliness is directed at an object.

#### 2. Subjectivist
This view treats loneliness more like a **mood** (like depression or fatigue). Rather than being directed at a specific object.

#### 3. Embodied/Enacted (Relationist)
This draws on ***"4E Cognition"*** (Embodied, Embedded, Enacted, Extended). It argues that loneliness isn't just "in the head." It is a breakdown in the dynamic, bodily **interaction** between the person and their environment

# Three Dimensions of Analysis

## Phenomenal Dimension

This dimension concerns the "what-it-is-like" quality of loneliness.

- **Feeling vs. Emotion:** Is it a raw sensation (like pain) or a complex emotion involving judgments (like grief)?
- **Correctness Conditions:** This is a crucial philosophical issue. If loneliness is a perception of social lack, can it be wrong? Can a person feel lonely (subjective) even if they are not socially isolated (objective)? If they can, then the experience might "misrepresent" reality.

## Social Dimension

This dimension investigates the **content** of the lack. Not all interactions cure loneliness. This dimension asks:

- **Relevance:** Which relationships matter? (e.g., "stability, intimacy, recognition").
- **Embodiment:** Does **digital contact** count? Seeman suggests that if the "embodied" view is correct, virtual interaction might fail because it lacks the physical resonance required for true connection.

## Normative/Cognitive Dimension

This dimension deals with the **standards** (norms) the subject uses to judge their life.

- **Normativity:** The pain of loneliness comes from comparing reality (what is) to an ideal (what ought to be).
- **Expectations:** Because loneliness is based on this gap, it is heavily influenced by **cultural and personal norms**. If a society expects high levels of extraversion, an introvert might feel lonely not because they lack friends, but because they fail to meet the "normative" expectation of connection.

# Distinctions from Related Concepts

### Vs Solitude
Solitude lacks the **negative valence** of loneliness. It is often a chosen state where the [[Roberts & Krueger#Pro-attitude|pro-attitude]] (desire) for connection is temporarily suspended or satisfied by oneself.
### Vs Depression
(Related: [[Ratcliffe and Strawson#Pathologies Chronic Depression and the "Glass Wall"|Ratcliffe Depression]], [[Roberts & Krueger#Chronic Loneliness|Chronic Loneliness]])
While depression involves a "global" flattening of affect or sadness directed at the "whole world" (as noted in the reading, page 8, citing Ratcliffe), loneliness has a specific **intentional object**: it is about the lack of social connection.
### Vs Social Anxiety
Anxiety is an **anticipatory** state characterized by **fear** of future interactions. Loneliness is a **responsive** state characterized by the **pain** of current disconnection.

# Philosophical Contributions and Implications

Seeman’s philosophical analysis has direct practical consequences for how we treat the condition.

- **Relational vs. Individual:** Because loneliness is **relational** (it happens between a subject and a world that fails to meet their needs), ***treating it solely as a medical pathology inside the brain is insufficient***

- **Quality over Quantity:** Since loneliness is defined by a **subjective discrepancy** (the gap between desired and actual connection), simply adding more people (quantity) does not solve it. Interventions must target the **normative dimension**: improving the quality of interaction so that it meets the subject's need for **mutual understanding** and **recognition**.
