# Critique of Traditional Approach

> "Attribution Theory: We attribute mental states using a folk psychological theory about how beliefs and desires cause behavior."  
> "Simulation Theory: We understand others by mentally simulating their experiences and imagining ourselves in their situation."  
> "The Problem: Both approaches miss something fundamental: our direct lived experience of others as persons."  
> (Ratcliffe, Slide 5)

Ratcliffe’s philosophical critique is that both accounts focus too heavily on **cognitive mindreading** (figuring out specific contents like "he believes X"). In doing so, they overlook the **direct lived experience** or the **felt sense** of encountering another entity as a person. We often recognize someone as a person immediately, without needing to theorize or simulate their internal psychology.

He argues that **Simulation is circular.** It assumes already recognizing something as a person. One wouldnt bother simulating a rock or a table. You only simulate entitites you already experience as persons. Therefore the sense of personhood must precede the act of simulation.

# Personhood as Primitive
(Strawson)

> "For Strawson, 'person' is a basic concept not built from mental + physical parts. We experience people as unified beings..."  
> "Strawson distinguishes between M-(material) and P(psychological)-predicates."  
> (Ratcliffe, Slide 6)

Ratcliffe adopts Strawsons stance that the **concept of person is primitive.** Thus its foundational and not one constructed by joining together two seperate things (a body + mind)

Strawson clarifies this using two types of predicates:

### M-predicate (Material):
Properties **shared** by objects and people. (weights 100kg, ...)

### P-predicate (Psychological):
Properties **specific** to persons (is smiling, is thinking, ...)

> The crucial point is that we ascribe both M and P predicates to **the same single entity** (the person), not to two different parts (body and mind). This supports the view that personhood is a **holistic perception**, not a cognitive assembly.

# The Phenomenology of Encountering Persons

Ratcliffe argues that there is a distinct **phenomenology** (a specific "feel") to encountering a person. This is usually **transparent** (we don't notice it because it's always there), but it becomes visible in moments of **ambiguity** or **pathology**

### Gestal Switch
When viewing a **waxwork** figure, you might initially perceive it as a person. When you realize it is wax, your experience shifts. The physical data (the visual input) hasn't changed, but the **phenomenological structure** shifts from "personal" to "impersonal."

### Uncanny
When the distinction blurs (e.g., a **talking doll or a robot**), we feel a sense of unease because our experiential categories of animate/inanimate are in conflict.

### Renee's Case
(Autobiography of Renee)
Renee having Schizophrenia perceives people physically as they are, yet they appear lifeless objects.
This proves that the **felt sense of the personal** is a distinct layer of experience. You can see the body (M-predicates) perfectly but lack the experience of the person (P-predicates)

# Bodily Dimension and Connection

> "Encountering persons involves immediate bodily and experiential changes."  
> (Ratcliffe, Slide 11)
> "Ratcliffe proposes that personal experience is fundamentally a felt sense of connectedness to others, not the successful replication (copy) of their psychological states."  
> "Even if low-level matching or simulation plays a role, it does not explain the relational structure that makes personal experience distinctive."  
> (Ratcliffe, Slide 12)

He argues that experiencing someone as a person is not a detached intellectual calculation but an **immediate bodily response**.

This **challenges** the **Simulation Theory** mentioned earlier. Simulation implies that I copy your mental state to understand you. Ratcliffe argues this is a category error; the experience of another person is a **relational structure** defined by a **felt sense of connectedness**.
- It is not that I have "my experience" and then "a simulation of your experience" running in parallel.
- Instead, my own bodily experience and my engagement with the world are altered by your presence. The core of personal experience is this **felt receptiveness** and the resulting **transformation** of the shared environment, rather than a cognitive hypothesis about what is happening in your head.

# Mutual Transformation
(Goldmans Example)

> "When we have read a book or poem so often that we can no longer find any amusement in reading it by ourselves, we can still take pleasure in reading it to a companion... we are amused by sympathy with his amusement which thus enlivens our own."  
> (Goldman/Smith Quote, Slide 17)
> 
> "The example does not involve two separate experiences (one’s own and a simulated one) coexisting side by side. Instead, the shared engagement reshapes the original experience—the once-dull book becomes enlivened through interaction."  
> "The experience is fundamentally collective: 'we' perceive the book together, mutually shaping each other’s perspectives."  
> (Ratcliffe, Slide 18)

Ratcliffe uses an example provided by Alvin Goldman (referencing Adam Smith) to **disprove** the idea that we just "simulate" others.
- **The Simulationist View** would claim the reader has two states: 1. Boredom (their own state), and 2. Excitement (a simulation of the friend's state).
- **Ratcliffe’s View** is that this is phenomenologically incorrect. The reader does not toggle between boredom and simulated excitement. The reader’s own experience of the book is **transformed**. The book itself becomes interesting again through the shared attention.

# Sartre - Experiencing the Other
(Shame and The Look)

Ratcliffe uses Sartre to further argue that experiencing another person is a direct, **bodily event**, not a cognitive theory.

- **Shame/Awkwardness as Pre-reflective:** Sartre argues that when we feel shame (e.g., being caught doing something awkward), we don't first think "Oh, a person is there," then think "They see me," and then feel shame. The feeling is instantaneous. It is an **"immediate shudder."** The awareness of the other person is **built into the feeling** itself. You cannot feel this specific type of shame without feeling it before someone.

- **The Look:** This concept describes the structure of encountering a person. It is not about physically seeing a pair of eyes. It is the **sense of being perceived**.
    - When I experience "The Look," I am no longer just a subject looking out at the world.
    - I suddenly experience myself as an **object** in their world.
    - This shift recognizes the other not as a thing, but as a **"locus of experience"** a center of gravity that defines me.

# Bodily Feelings and World Possibilities

> "Normally, the body functions as an **inconspicuous medium** for action and perception, not as an object of attention."  
> "When bodily experience changes, world-experience changes with it."  
> "In **the keyhole example**, the voyeur’s sudden awareness of another transforms her body into an **object**... the **possibilities offered by the world collapse**."  
> (Ratcliffe, Slide 24)

This section connects the feeling of the **body to the structure of the world.**

- **The Body as Medium:** Usually, we don't think about our bodies; **we look through them** to act on the world (e.g., reaching for a door handle without looking at your hand). The body is an inconspicuous medium.

- **The Keyhole Example:** Sartre describes a jealous person peeping through a keyhole.  
    - Initially: The person is absorbed in the act. The world is full of **possibilities** related to spying (the door, the view).
    - The Change: Footsteps are heard. Suddenly, the person feels **shame**.

- **The Transformation:**
    1. **Bodily:** The body stops being a "medium" and becomes an **awkward object** (I feel exposed, hunched, vulnerable).
    2. **Worldly:** The possibilities of the world **collapse** or flow away. The door is no longer a tool for spying; it is a trap. The world is no longer organized around my project; it is organized around the Other's view of me.

# Løgstrup: Trust, Openness, and Shaping Worlds

Ratcliffe moves beyond Sartre’s confrontational view (where others steal our world) to Knud Løgstrup’s view, which emphasizes **interdependence**.

- **Who vs. What:** Personal experience involves receptiveness to a "Who" (a unique individual) rather than a "What" (a social type or category).

- **Shaping Worlds:** When we interact, we do not just exchange information. Our mere presence, gestures, and attitudes fundamentally alter the **"tone"** of the other person's reality. We make their world larger or smaller, brighter or duller.

- **Inescapable Responsibility:** Because we cannot help but affect the people we encounter, we hold a power over their world-experience. Recognizing someone as a person means recognizing this power and the **trust** that is implicit in the interaction.

- **Vulnerability:** A fully personal relation requires a balance. We must be **open** to being transformed by them, which entails **vulnerability**. If we are defensive or closed off, the sense of the person diminishes.

# Pathologies: Chronic Depression and the "Glass Wall"
(also covered in [[Roberts & Krueger#Chronic Loneliness|Chronic Lonliness]])

> "Severe depression often involves a **loss of felt interpersonal connection**. A painful awareness of that absence."  
> "There is a **paradoxical tension**: sufferers yearn for connection but feel incapable of experiencing it comfortably."  
> (Ratcliffe, Slide 37)
> 
> "Sylvia Plath describes this as being enclosed under a **glass bell jar**. Another description likens it to being **trapped inside a balloon**."  
> "The phenomenology suggests an **inversion of Sartre’s view**: while he emphasized how others can constrain possibilities, depression shows that others also **expand and sustain our experiential possibilities**."  
> (Ratcliffe, Slides 37 & 38)


Ratcliffe uses depression to demonstrate that **personhood** is tied to **possibility**

- **The Experience of Separation:** The depressed subject feels an impenetrable barrier (glass jar, balloon, wall) between themselves and others. It is not just that people aren't there; it is that the **possibility** of connecting with them feels irrevocably lost.

- **The Inversion of Sartre:** Sartre argued that "The Look" of others limits our freedom and solidifies us into objects. Depression shows the opposite truth: without the connection to others, the world loses its depth and vitality. The world feels "closed" or "small" because others are required to **sustain the possibilities** of the world.

- **Estrangement:** Others appear "phantom-like" or "intangible." Because the felt connection is broken, the sufferer feels estranged not just from people, but from the shared world itself.

# Schizophrenia & The "Praecox Feeling"
[[Dictionary#Praecox|Praecox]]

> "R. D. Laing observes that in **psychotic conditions**, the presence of others can feel like **intrusion or penetration** into the self."  
> "Others are experienced primarily as **sources of threat**, reducing their individuality to roles that convey danger."  
> (Ratcliffe, Slide 41)
> 
> "Some interactions feel essentially **lacking in personhood**... The experience is one of **uncanniness**... or missing relational potential."  
> "Minkowski describes a patient whose psyche felt **too fully known**, leaving no open future... experienced more like a **complete object** than a locus of potential."  
> (Ratcliffe, Slide 42)

Ratcliffe examines Schizophrenia to show what happens **when the "openness" of personhood collapses**.

**Paranoid Schizophrenia:** The balance of vulnerability is lost. The subject feels totally exposed or "penetrated" by the other. Because the other is viewed purely as a **threat**, the nuance of their personality vanishes—they become a "manikin" or a "force" rather than a person.
#### Praecox Feeling:
The unease clinicians sometimes feel when interacting with schizophrenic patients. It arises because the interaction lacks **relational potential**.

**Objectification:** Minkowski’s example of the patient who felt "too fully known" is crucial. To be a person is to be **unpredictable** and to have an **open future**. If someone appears completely static, predictable, or "finished" (like a book you've already read), they are experienced as an **object**, not a person. This proves that **unpredictability** is a core requirement for the experience of personhood.
