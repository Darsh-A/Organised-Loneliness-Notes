# The Central Thesis: Time Consciousness and Loneliness

Mijuskovic’s central argument posits a fundamental link between how we experience **time** and our existential **loneliness**.

- **Critique of Materialism:** He argues that **materialism** (the view that reality is just matter in motion) is insufficient to explain human existence. Materialism deals with "extensiveness" (physical space) and causality, but it cannot explain **spontaneity** (freedom) or the internal unity of the self.

- **The Enclosed Self:** To account for personal identity and self-consciousness, we must look to **idealism**. However, this inward turn reveals a difficult truth: the structure of our consciousness creates an "imprisoned solitude of the individual ego, as it is trapped within its own unique temporal sphere of self-awareness." (Reading, p. 9).

# Objective vs Immanent Time

- **Objective (Scientific) Time:** 
  This is the time of the physical world. It is **intersubjective** (shared by everyone) and **measured externally** (clocks, movement of planets). Crucially, it is spatialized—it turns time into points on a line. It treats time as "linear and inflexible... consisting of separate points distributed as dots." (Reading, p. 32).

- **Immanent (Subjective) Time:** 
  This is the time of the **mind**. It is "lived, not measured." It is defined by a **continuous flow** of thoughts and feelings. This time does not require space (we can experience it "in the dark with nothing visibly moving"). It is **constituted** (created) by the mind itself. This internal time is the **foundation of the isolated ego** because, unlike objective time, it **cannot be truly shared**.

# Leibniz

## Monad and Self-Enclosure

> "The spiritual Monad is an **absolutely self-enclosed substance**. Nothing enters from without, and nothing escapes from within."  
> "The monads have **no windows** through which anything could come in or go out."  
> (Mijuskovic Reading, Page 11 / Slides 7 & 15)

Leibniz radicalizes the concept of the self through his theory of the **Monad**.

- **Windowless:** The Monad (the soul) is a completely self-contained unit. It has "no windows." This means that our perceptions are not actually caused by the outside world entering our minds. Instead, "all consciousness, perceptions, and self-conscious activity must be **spontaneously self-generated from within the monadic soul**." (Reading, p. 11).
 
- **Qualitative Richness (vs. Descartes):** While Descartes viewed the self (***Cogito***) as a static, empty point of certainty, Leibniz views the Monad as **dynamic**. It is "chock-full" of internal content (perceptions) and defined by **temporal continuity**, a series of internal changes held together by the unity of the self. (Reading, p. 10).
 
- **Loneliness Implication:** If the Monad is windowless and all experience is self-generated, then we are metaphysically isolated. We do not directly touch the world or others; we only experience our own internal modifications.


## Leibniz vs Descartes

### Time: Instant vs Continuous
**Descartes (Cogito)** - Time is external to the mind. Instantaneous intuition, Time deepends on God.
**Leibniz (Monad)** - Monad (self) is inherently temporal. It is not just a series of flashes, but is a continuous flow. The self binds the past, present and future together from *within*

### Content: Empty vs Chock-full
**Descartes (Cogito)** - Descartes views the self as a "pure translucent medium" (Reading, p. 13). It is the act of awareness itself, stripped of sensory richness. It is a "**non-sensuous act**."
**Leibniz (Monad)** - For Leibniz, the self is not just a blank flashlight; it is a container filled with perceptions, feelings, and thoughts. Even if the Monad has no windows (no input from outside), it generates a rich internal life of **qualitative** experiences.

### Unity: Static vs Dynamic
**Descartes (Cogito)** - Because Descartes self is instantaneous and empty, its unity is **static**. It doesn't grow or develop; it just is.
**Leibniz (Monad)** - Leibniz introduces **"unity-through-change."** The self changes (it has different perceptions at different times), yet it remains the same self. This requires a **dynamic** power to hold these changes together.

# Kant: Transcendental Time-Consciousness

Kant builds upon Leibniz but transforms the "monad" into a more rigorous structure called **Transcendental Idealism**.

### Spontaneity vs Empiricism
**Empiricism** (like Hume) views the mind as passive, a "blank tablet" receiving impressions. It relies on "passive association" (habits of memory). 
**Kant’s Spontaneity:** Kant argues the mind is **active**. It does not just receive time; **it creates time**. **Spontaneity** is the mind's active power to generate the structures (categories) that make experience possible.

### The Three-Fold Synthesis
To have a unified experience (like hearing a sentence or a melody), the mind must perform three **a priori synthetic acts** (Reading, p. 14 / Slide 22):
    1. **Apprehension:** Grasping the immediate sensory data (the raw "redness" or "sound").
    2. **Reproduction:** The imagination must hold onto the past moment (retaining the first word of the sentence while hearing the last).
    3. **Recognition:** Conceptual unification—recognizing that the "I" who heard the start is the same "I" hearing the end.

### The Unity of Apperception  
This is Kant’s term for **reflexive self-consciousness**. For any experience to belong to me, "It must be possible for the 'I think' to accompany all my representations." Without this unifying "I," thoughts would be scattered and disconnected.

# Bergson - Duration (Durée)

Bergson critiques the scientific view of time and proposes a theory of **Duration** (real, lived time).

### Quantitative vs Qualitative
- **Science (Quantitative):** Science treats time like space. It cuts time into separate, measurable dots on a line. It is "abstract, quantitative, spatial, deterministic"
- **Intuition (Qualitative):** To know the self, we must use **intuition**, not analysis. Intuition grasps **Duration**, a flow where moments are not separate but "**interpenetrate**" or melt into each other.

### Melody Metaphor
In a melody we you dont hear seperate notes, You hear a continuous flow where the past notes color the present ones. If you seperate them you destroy the melody. The self is like a melody - a **multiplicity in unity**

### Loneliness and Freedom
Bergson argues that deep within, the self is a monadic and temporally self-enclosed entity. In moments of **decisive action**, the self acts from its own internal Duration, free from external causes.

This freedom is absolute, but it confirms our isolation: we live together in a communal space, but we **exist alone in an intimate time**
