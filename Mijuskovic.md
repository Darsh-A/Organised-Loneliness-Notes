# The Central Thesis: Time Consciousness and Loneliness

Mijuskovic’s central argument posits a fundamental link between how we experience **time** and our existential **loneliness**.

- **Critique of Materialism:** He argues that **materialism** (the view that reality is just matter in motion) is insufficient to explain human existence. Materialism deals with "extensiveness" (physical space) and causality, but it cannot explain **spontaneity** (freedom) or the internal unity of the self.

- **The Enclosed Self:** To account for personal identity and self-consciousness, we must look to **idealism**. However, this inward turn reveals a difficult truth: the structure of our consciousness creates an "imprisoned solitude of the individual ego, as it is trapped within its own unique temporal sphere of self-awareness." (Reading, p. 9).

# Objective vs Immanent Time

- **Objective (Scientific) Time:** 
  This is the time of the physical world. It is **intersubjective** (shared by everyone) and **measured externally** (clocks, movement of planets). Crucially, it is spatialized—it turns time into points on a line. It treats time as "linear and inflexible... consisting of separate points distributed as dots." (Reading, p. 32).

- **Immanent (Subjective) Time:** 
  This is the time of the **mind**. It is "lived, not measured." It is defined by a **continuous flow** of thoughts and feelings. This time does not require space (we can experience it "in the dark with nothing visibly moving"). It is **constituted** (created) by the mind itself. This internal time is the **foundation of the isolated ego** because, unlike objective time, it **cannot be truly shared**.

## Monad and Self-Enclosure

> "The spiritual Monad is an **absolutely self-enclosed substance**. Nothing enters from without, and nothing escapes from within."

Leibniz radicalizes the concept of the self through his theory of the **Monad**.

- **Windowless:** The Monad (the soul) is a completely self-contained unit. It has "no windows." This means that our perceptions are not actually caused by the outside world entering our minds. Instead, "all consciousness, perceptions, and self-conscious activity must be **spontaneously self-generated from within the monadic soul**." (Reading, p. 11).
 
- **Qualitative Richness (vs. Descartes):** While Descartes viewed the self (***Cogito***) as a static, empty point of certainty, Leibniz views the Monad as **dynamic**. It is "chock-full" of internal content (perceptions) and defined by **temporal continuity**, a series of internal changes held together by the unity of the self. (Reading, p. 10).
 
- **Loneliness Implication:** If the Monad is windowless and all experience is self-generated, then we are metaphysically isolated. We do not directly touch the world or others; we only experience our own internal modifications.
