# The Central Thesis: Time Consciousness and Loneliness

Mijuskovic’s central argument posits a fundamental link between how we experience **time** and our existential **loneliness**.

- **Critique of Materialism:** He argues that **materialism** (the view that reality is just matter in motion) is insufficient to explain human existence. Materialism deals with "extensiveness" (physical space) and causality, but it cannot explain **spontaneity** (freedom) or the internal unity of the self.

- **The Enclosed Self:** To account for personal identity and self-consciousness, we must look to **idealism**. However, this inward turn reveals a difficult truth: the structure of our consciousness creates an "imprisoned solitude of the individual ego, as it is trapped within its own unique temporal sphere of self-awareness." (Reading, p. 9).
