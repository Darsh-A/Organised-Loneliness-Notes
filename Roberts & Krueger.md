# Defining Lonliness
(And the emotion of absense)

> "Loneliness: An affective state in which **valued social goods** are experienced as missing and out of reach. Not just lack of interaction, but the felt **unattainability** of meaningful connection."  
> (Roberts & Krueger, Slide 2)

>"Some emotions are fundamentally about what is missing, not what is present. These emotions are intentionally directed at absences or blocked possibilities."  
 (Roberts & Krueger, Slide 4)

#### An Emotion of Absense:
To understand loneliness philosophically, we must classify it as an **affective state** (a state of feeling or emotion) rather than a mere physical circumstance. It is distinct because its **intentionality** (what the emotion is about) is directed not at a present object (like fear is directed at a snake), but at an **absence**.

##### "The Family of Emotions:" 
This places loneliness in a family of emotions including **grief** (the absence of a loved one), **nostalgia** (the absence of a past time), and **homesickness** (the absence of a familiar place).

*Keywords:* Unattainability, Blocked Possibility, lack/absense of interaction

# Two Part Structure

> ***1. Pro-attitude Toward Valued Good***: Desire, longing, and appreciation for something that is valued. This creates the *emotional investment in the missing good*.
> ***2. Awareness of Unattainability***: Realization that the good is missing or unreachable.
> - Cognitive: Judgments about loss or impossibility
> - Embodied: Felt inability
> - Perceptual: World no longer affords certain actions. 
> (Roberts & Krueger, Slide 5)

Both the structures/concepts can be explained as follows:
#### Pro-attitude:
The subject must actively desire or value the social good. One cannot be lonely if one is indifferent to connection. This **emotional investment** is the *prerequisite for the suffering*; without the "pro-attitude" (the positive desire), the state would be merely **solitude** (a neutral or positive state), not loneliness.

#### Awareness of Unattainability:
The subject must perceive that these desires cannot be met. This awareness manifests in **three dimensions**: 
- **Cognitive:** A judgment that connection is impossible (e.g., "Nobody understands me").
- **Embodied:** A [[Dictionary#Somatically|somatic]] (bodily) sense of **felt inability** or lack of confidence to bridge the gap.
- **Perceptual:** The environment is perceived as lacking **affordances**—the world looks like a place that does not offer opportunities (affordances) for *social* interaction.

# Objective vs Subjective Loneliness

> "Objective Loneliness: Low frequency/quantity of social contact. Measurable networks. Not sufficient for the emotional experience."  
> "Subjective Loneliness: Felt unattainability of meaningful social connection. Can occur when alone, in crowds, or within relationships. A dispositional state with recurring episodes."  
> (Roberts & Krueger, Slide 6)


### Objective Loneliness
Quantified by **measurable networks** and frequency of interaction. It is a **third-person** observation (e.g., "Subject X has spoken to zero people today"). However, this is **not sufficient** to constitute the emotion of loneliness, because a person may be isolated without possessing the "*pro-attitude*" (desire) for connection (i.e., they are in solitude)

### Subjective Loneliness
Is the feeling fo **depreivation**. It is defined by the **felt unattainability** of connection.
it is a tendency or a chronic condition of the character, where the person is prone to **recurring episodes** of feeling this absence.
Because it is subjective and based on "felt unattainability," it can occur even when the objective conditions for contact are met (e.g., being lonely in a crowd or a marriage).

# The Missing Social Goods (What the lonely person craves)

To understand the intentionality of loneliness (what the emotion is about), we must catalogue the specific **social goods** that the subject **desires but finds unattainable**. The authors argue that loneliness is not just a craving for generic contact, but for specific forms of **interpersonal flourishing**.
- **Companionship and Shared Pleasure:** mutually enjoyable social interaction
- **Emotional and Moral Support:** absense of validation and sympathy
- **Opportunities for Social Agency:** Character traits that are relational to the environment. The subject cannot flourish as a social agent as their traits are supressed.
- **Cognitive and Emotional Burden Reduction:** solving problems alone (cognitive load) and emotional processing leading to a state of exhaustion.

# Phenomenology (How it feels)

The **phenomenology** of loneliness describes the structure of the experience from the first-person perspective. Roberts and Krueger divide this into how the world appears and how the self appears.

### World Directed:
- **Alienation/Exclusion:** Even in a crowd, others are perceived as socially inaccessible.
- **Blocked Affordances:** The world is perceived as lacking invitations. Faces look closed; groups look impenetrable. The environment does not **offer** the possibility of connection.

### Self DIrected (Embodied):
- **Bodily Awkwardness:** The awareness of unattainability manifests [[Dictionary#Somatically|Somatically]]. The body feels ineffective or clumsy because it cannot sync with others
- **Blocked Expression:** Because a subject cannot express traits like humour or affection, they suffer a *diminshed sense of self-realization*
- **Social Performance (Faking):** Subject resorts to inauthenticity, performing a role rather than engaging in genuine connection. This reinforces the feeling of being hidden/unseen.

### Temporal:
- **Past Comparisons:** The present absense is highlighted by the memory of a *Better social past*
- **Bleak Future Antticipation:** Viewing the future as a socially [[Dictionary#Impoverish|impoverished]] landscape, which reinforces current despair

# Loneliness vs Solitude

The authors distinguish between these two states based on the presence or absence of the [[Roberts & Krueger#Pro-attitude| pro-attiude]] toward social connection.

### Loneliness:
Is defined by **frustration.** It is the collision of a desire for connection against the wall of **unattainability.** Thus the subject feels blocked form realizing their social self.

### Solitude:
State of being alone without the lack/desire of social goods (companionship, intimacy, ..)
Because pro-attiude is absent, theres no frustration. Instead Solitude is often **chosen or accepted.**

> The key distinction is that solitude is a state of **choosing absence**, whereas loneliness is the state of **suffering absence**

# Chronic Loneliness
The authors argue that when loneliness persists over time, it undergoes a **qualitative shift**. It transforms from an "acute" emotional state (characterized by the sharp pain of missing someone) into a **chronic condition** characterized by **[[Dictionary#Devitalization|devitalization]]**

- **Affective Flattening:** The emotional landscape becomes flat or numb. This is a defense mechanism where the constant frustration of desire leads to the extinguishing of that desire.

- **Loss of Salience:** In acute loneliness, the social world is highly [[Dictionary#Salient|salient]] because the subject craves it. In chronic loneliness, the **social world loses salience**. Other people and social opportunities cease to show up as "possibilities" or "affordances" for the subject. They become background noise.

- **Devitalization:** This state resembles **depression**. The subject no longer actively seeks the "social goods" because they no longer view the world as a place that can provide them. The "pro-attitude" (desire) that defined the acute state eventually erodes, leaving the subject in a state of deep, existential withdrawal.
