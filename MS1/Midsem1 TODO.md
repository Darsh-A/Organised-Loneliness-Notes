 
# Part 1: Loneliness as an Emotion of Absence (Roberts & Krueger)

## 1. Defining Loneliness 
*   **The Core Definition:** An affective state where valued social goods are experienced as missing and out of reach.
*   **The "Emotion of Absence":**
    *   How emotions can be directed at things that *aren't* there (like grief, nostalgia, homesickness, unrequited love).
    *   The concept of "blocked possibilities."
## 2. The Two-Part Structure of Loneliness
*   **Component 1: Pro-attitude:** Desire, longing, or appreciation for a valued social good.
*   **Component 2: Awareness of Unattainability:** The realization that the good is unreachable (cognitive judgment, embodied feeling of inability, or perceptual affordances).

## 3. Types of Loneliness
*   **Objective Loneliness:**
    *   Low frequency/quantity of contact.
    *   Measurable/observable.
    *   *Note:* Not sufficient for the emotional experience.
*   **Subjective Loneliness:**
    *   Felt unattainability of connection.
    *   Can occur even when surrounded by others (crowds, relationships).
    *   Dispositional state (recurring episodes).

## 4. The Missing "Social Goods" (What the lonely person craves)
*   **Companionship & Shared Pleasure:** Presence of others to share joy/activities.
*   **Emotional & Moral Support:** Trust, validation, comfort.
*   **Physical Affection & Intimacy:** Touch, safety.
*   **Bonds:** Friendship, romance, family (identity/belonging).
*   **Social Agency:** Opportunities to express oneself (humor, vulnerability).
*   **Burden Reduction:** Sharing cognitive/emotional loads.

## 5. Phenomenology (How it feels)
*   **World-directed:** Feeling excluded/alienated; perceiving others as inaccessible; "a wall" between self and others.
*   **Self-directed:** Feeling socially awkward, blocked expression, forced social performance (inauthenticity).
*   **Temporal:** Painful comparisons to the past; bleak anticipation of the future.

## 6. Impact on the Self
*   **Burden:** Managing life alone feels heavier.
*   **Diminishment:** Loss of purpose, confidence, and social roles.
*   **Stifled Flourishing:** Inability to realize oneself because growth requires others.

## 7. Loneliness vs. Solitude
*   **Loneliness:** Painful, alienating, desire for contact + unattainability.
*   **Solitude:** Positive/neutral, chosen, no craving for contact, enables creativity/rest.

## 8. Chronic Loneliness
*   **Affective Flattening:** Transition from acute pain to emotional numbness/devitalization.
*   **Loss of Desire:** The social world loses salience; possibilities no longer appear as options.
*   **Resemblance to Depression:** Defined by lack of vitality rather than active pain.

# Part 2: The Structure of Interpersonal Experience (Matthew Ratcliffe)

**1. Critique of Traditional Approaches**
*   **The "Theory" Approach (Attribution Theory):** Understanding others by using folk psychology to attribute beliefs/desires.
*   **The "Simulation" Approach:** Understanding others by mentally simulating their situation.
*   **The Critique:** Both fail to account for the direct, *lived experience* of others as persons.

**2. Personhood as Primitive (Strawson)**
*   **The Concept:** "Person" is a basic concept, not built from separate mental + physical parts.
*   **Predicates:**
    *   *M-predicates:* Material characteristics (weight, size).
    *   *P-predicates:* Psychological characteristics (smiling, thinking).
    *   *Immediate Recognition:* We perceive persons holistically, not inferentially.

**3. The Phenomenology of Encountering Persons**
*   **Immediate Recognition:** We don't infer personhood; we feel it.
*   **Ambiguity/Gestalt Switch:** The shift in experience when a waxwork is revealed to be fake.
*   **The Uncanny:** The disturbing feeling when the animate/inanimate distinction is blurred (e.g., dolls, robot gazes).

**4. The Bodily Dimension & Connection**
*   **Felt Connection:** Personal experience is a felt sense of connectedness, not a cognitive simulation.
*   **Sartre’s Insight ("The Look"):**
    *   Being seen by another transforms one's own bodily experience.
    *   **World Transformation:** The presence of another reshapes the *possibilities* of the world (things become "ours" or "theirs").
*   **Goldman’s Example (Reading a Book):** Reading to a companion changes the experience of the book itself (mutual transformation), disproving pure simulation theory.

**5. Mutual Transformation & Possibility**
*   **Shared Experience:** The world appears differently when shared (e.g., Van den Berg’s example of showing a town to a guest).
*   **Possibilities:**
    *   *Mine, Yours, Ours:* Interpersonal experience involves a dynamic interplay of possibilities.
    *   *Enrichment vs. Impoverishment:* Others can expand or contract our world.
*   **Løgstrup’s View:** Relating to a person involves openness, trust, and vulnerability (inescapable responsibility for shaping the other's world).

**6. Pathologies of Interpersonal Experience**
*   **Chronic Depression:**
    *   Loss of felt connection (feeling cut off, "glass bell jar").
    *   Others appear as "phantoms" or "manikins."
    *   Inversion of Sartre: The *absence* of others collapses the world's possibilities.
*   **Schizophrenia (Paranoid type):**
    *   Presence of others felt as intrusion/penetration (Laing).
    *   Others experienced primarily as sources of threat.
*   **Interpersonal Oddness ("Praecox Feeling"):**
    *   Experience of others as lacking potential or openness.
    *   The other feels "finished" or object-like (no open future).

# Part 3: The Psychological Structure of Loneliness (Axel Seeman)

**1. Core Argument**
*   Loneliness is not just being alone; it is a subjective state rooted in how one experiences relationships.
*   **Key Definition:** A perceived mismatch/discrepancy between *desired* and *actual* social connection.

**2. The Standard View of Loneliness**
*   It is an **experience** (subjective).
*   It has **negative valence** (distressing/unpleasant).
*   It is **intentional/representational** (about a lack of connection).

**3. Three Philosophical Approaches to Loneliness**
*   **Objectivist (Intentionalist):** Focuses on the "object" of loneliness (what is missing? Is it a person? A social good?).
*   **Subjectivist:** Focuses on loneliness as a "mood" or holistic coloring of the sufferer's psyche/world.
*   **Embodied/Enacted (Relationist):** Focuses on the interaction between the person and their environment (social affordances).

**4. Dimensions of Analysis**
*   **Phenomenal Dimension:**
    *   The "what-it-is-like" to feel lonely.
    *   Is it a feeling or an emotion?
    *   Can it misrepresent reality? (Feeling lonely vs. Being lonely).
*   **Social Dimension:**
    *   What constitutes a meaningful connection?
    *   Interaction types: In-person vs. virtual; bodily presence; reciprocity.
*   **Normative/Cognitive Dimension:**
    *   The role of expectations: Loneliness depends on what we *think* relationships should be.
    *   Cultural/Personal norms: What counts as "enough" varies by individual and society.

**5. Distinctions & Implications**
*   **Loneliness vs. Solitude/Depression/Anxiety:** Specific focus on social disconnection.
*   **Social Nature:** Loneliness is inherently relational, not just an internal pathology.
*   **Intervention:** Solving it requires addressing the *quality* of relationships and mutual understanding, not just increasing contact.

# Part 4: Philosophical Roots (Ben Lazare Mijuskovic)

**1. The Central Thesis**
*   Immanent (Subjective) time-consciousness is fundamentally linked to human loneliness.
*   Materialism (matter + motion) cannot explain human spontaneity, self-consciousness, or the unity of the self.
*   **The "Enclosed" Self:** The structure of our consciousness (trapped in our own time/mind) creates an existential solitude.

**2. Two Concepts of Time**
*   **Objective (Scientific) Time:**
    *   Intersubjective (public).
    *   Based on motion/space (measurement).
    *   External to the mind.
*   **Immanent (Subjective) Time:**
    *   Constituted in the mind.
    *   Lived flow (continuous).
    *   Independent of external movement.
    *   Grounds the existential solitude of the ego.

**3. Leibniz: The Monad**
*   **The Monad:** An immaterial, active substance (the soul).
*   **"Windowless":** Nothing enters or leaves; perceptions are self-generated (Spontaneity).
*   **Comparison to Descartes:**
    *   *Descartes' Cogito:* Instantaneous, empty of content, static.
    *   *Leibniz's Monad:* Temporally continuous, rich internal content, dynamic unity.
*   **Personal Identity:** Constituted by the internal series of changes (perceptions) held together by the monad's unity.

**4. Kant: Transcendental Time-Consciousness**
*   **Spontaneity:** The mind actively generates categories (it is not a passive blank slate).
*   **Three-fold Synthetic Activity:**
    1.  *Apprehension:* Grasping sensory intuition.
    2.  *Reproduction:* Imaginative retention.
    3.  *Recognition:* Conceptual unification (The "I think").
*   **Dual Function:** The mind creates time *and* becomes conscious of it.
*   **Unity of Apperception:** The reflexive "I think" that must accompany all representations to make them *mine*.

**5. Bergson: Duration (*Durée*)**
*   **Critique of Science:** Science spatializes time (turns it into static dots/lines).
*   **Intuition:** The only way to grasp reality (qualitative, not quantitative).
*   **Duration:**
    *   The "Melody" Metaphor: Notes are not separate; they melt into one another.
    *   **Freedom:** Freedom exists in the spontaneous, durational moment (which is unrepeatable and unique to the self).

**6. Husserl: Internal Time-Consciousness**
*   **Phenomenology of Flux:** Time is a continuous stream.
*   **Structure:**
    *   *Retention:* Holding the just-past (essential to hearing a melody, otherwise it’s just isolated noise).
    *   *Protention:* Anticipating the future.
*   **The Transcendental Ego:** The ego constitutes this flow; it is the "pole of identity" that lives through the stream.
*   **Critique of Empiricism/Associationism:** Rejected causal/naturalistic explanations of time. Meaning comes from the *continuity* of consciousness.

**7. Key Takeaway (Mijuskovic)**
*   These philosophers (Leibniz, Kant, Bergson, Husserl) show that the self is an **active, temporally structured, and self-enclosed unity.**
*   This subjective enclosure—where "mine" never passes into "yours"—is the philosophical root of **existential loneliness.**

# Missing stuff

### **Missing from Part 1: Roberts & Krueger**

**From Slide 12: Philosophical Significance**  
I covered the definition of loneliness, but Slide 12 specifically lists how loneliness contributes to broader philosophy.

- **Emotions about Absences:** Loneliness is a case study that proves emotions can be intentional states directed at nothing (or rather, the absence of something), refuting theories that say emotions must be about present objects.
    
- **Suffering from Blocked Possibilities:** It shows that suffering doesn't just come from "bad events" (like an injury) but from "blocked possibilities"—not being able to do what you want to do.
    
- **Clinical Relevance:** It offers a framework for psychiatry to distinguish between **social withdrawal** (behavior) and **loneliness** (feeling), which is crucial for diagnosing depression vs. solitude.

### **Missing from Part 2: Matthew Ratcliffe**

**From Slide 26: Phenomenological Context (Husserl & Merleau-Ponty)**  
I mentioned the body generally, but Slide 26 explicitly links this to specific phenomenological concepts.

- **Husserl:** The body is not just a perceived object; it is an **"organ of perception."** It is the tool through which we feel the "affective force" of the world (whether things are enticing or repulsive).
    
- **Merleau-Ponty:** He argues that when we see a living body, the surrounding objects immediately take on a **"fresh layer of significance."** The world doesn't just look physical; it looks like a tool for that person. (e.g., I see a hammer not just as wood/metal, but as something he can grab).
    

**From Slide 32: The Cup Analogy**  
This is a specific analogy Ratcliffe uses to explain **Recognition**.

- **The Analogy:** "Just as recognizing something as a cup involves grasping the possibility of drinking from it, recognizing someone as a person involves grasping the **possibility of meaningful interpersonal relations**."
    
- **Significance:** You don't have to drink from every cup you see, but you can't see it as a cup unless you know you could drink from it. Similarly, you don't have to interact with everyone, but you can't see them as a person unless you feel the potential for interaction.

### **Missing from Part 4: Ben Lazare Mijuskovic**

**From Slide 6: Literary Parallels (Stream of Consciousness)**  
The slide explicitly links the philosophical theory of subjective time to literature.

- **Stream-of-Consciousness Narrative:** This literary style illustrates the "existential solitude of the ego."
    
- **Key Authors:**
    
    - **James Joyce (Ulysses):** His narrative style mimics the **immanent flow** of the mind—continuous, internal, and unshared. It shows the self trapped in its own unique temporal sphere.
        
    - **Thomas Wolfe:** His work illustrates the connection between inner temporality and isolation.
        

**From Slide 14: Space and Time (Newton vs. Leibniz)**  
I discussed time, but Slide 14 specifically contrasts their views on **Space** as well.

- **Newton:** Viewed Space and Time as **"Absolute containers"** (almost divine). They exist independently of whether things are in them. (The "Box" view).
    
- **Leibniz:** Viewed Space and Time as **"Relative Relations."** They are not containers. Space is just the order of co-existing things; Time is the order of successive things. They are **mental/relational constructs** arising from perception, not external substances.
